===========

Hacky iOS Code that features an interestingly new approach to RSS Readers on mobile.

# Context

Google Readers shut down. I participated in a hackathon. I decided to build something useful to enhance RSS.

# Dependencies

The web stack depends on [Romac's reader repo](https://github.com/romac/reader/tree/hackathon).
